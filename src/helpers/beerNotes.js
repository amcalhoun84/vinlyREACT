export function LegumeNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Legumes are a vast variety of seeds and pods that are used across the world in a nearly infinite variety of dishes. They generally pair with lighter white wines, but try a medium bodied or even rich red can work wonders. Try a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon the next time you order Channa Malsala.</p>
  );
};

export function FruitNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Fruit, like many foods, actually pairs with a fairly diverse family of wines. Popular 'breakfast/dessert' and 'sparkling' wines are particularly good.</p>
  );
};

export function NutNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Nuts can be savory or sweet and are often an accroutament to other foods, but often they are served in tasting courses or as a main feature in a 'light' meal situation. Try one of the following wines next time you are out nut tasting!</p>
  );
};

export function TubersNote(props) {
  return (
    <p> While not commonly a main course, potatoes and their relatives are often found as entrees or side dishes and pair beautifully depending on what they are topped with or how they are cooked. Redder wines go better with grilled and meat or dark sauced tuber dishes, e.g: Loaded Baked Potatoes with Chili.</p>
  );
};

export function VegNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Most commonly seen as sides or hor d'ouerves, vegetables actually pair with a great variety of white wines of nearly every body type. Crudite plates pair best with drier whites like a Chenin Blanc.</p>
  );
};

export function PastaNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Pasta is a wondefully diverse food. The sauce it is cooked with often determines the pairing. These are the more common suggestions for <em>all</em> pastas, but a safe recommendation is to go with a white wine for cream and citrus/light sauces and red wine for red sauces.</p>
  );
};

export function PoultryNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Chicken, turkey, duck, and game fowl are frequently paired with white and medium bodied red wine.</p>
  );
};

export function DairyNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Dairy in this case refers to yogurt dishes or dishes where cream or milk are a forefront element, regardless of the animal origin. Dairy can be quite hard to pair, but it can be done. There are general suggestions. If you are having a cream dish, stay away from red wines. If you are looking to pair with a specific cheese, check out Cheese To Wine (coming soon!)</p>
  );
};

export function EggNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Eggs are massively versatile. While generally savory, egg dishes can also be sweet. Whites go best, but salty or meat-heavy savory crepes and omeletes will pair well with middle bodied red wines. Chardonnay is acceptable as long as it is <em>NOT</em> oaky.</p>
  );
};

export function RedMeatNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Red Meat covers a wide variety of meats, not just beef. Almost all red meat pairings are red wine. Though ham is considered a 'pork' product, it is better paired with wines that compliment red meat, and other meats such as a lamb/mutton, bison, buffalo, game meats, etc. can all be considered red meats. Some have more specific pairings, but the following are generally good bets.</p>
  );
};

export function FungiNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Fungi is a funny food. It is like a vegetable, but often is paired best with a red wine. Not always the case, but due to the high protein, often chewy nature of many popular mushrooms, they pair very well with medium bodied red wines. Due to their versatility as a culinary option, fungi often pair well with red, white, and sparkling wines.</p>
  );
};

export function PorkNote(props) {
  return (
    <p>Pork is a versatile meat, in that it can mimic the flavors and textures of white meat or be heady and heavy like red meat depending on the cut from the pig or boar. Hams tend to go better with red and blush wines, while ribs are versatile depending on the spice or sauce, and chops go well with lighter bodied red wines and a wide variety of whites. The sauces any of these are prepared with; however, can greatly affect the wine choice. A good rule of thumb is if the sauce is white or light, a white wine might be better, while darker sauces, especially heavily salted gravies are better with reds.</p>
  );
};

export function BakedGoodsNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Frequently related to desserts, baked goods can also be savory. It really depends on the style and whether the filling is savory or sweet. Meat pies will pair with their respective meats. Red wine goes well with red meat pies, while poultry based meat pies go well with whites and medium bodied reds. Sweet dessert baked goods go best with sweet or dry dessert wines. This list assumes you are looking more for sweet baked goods than savory.</p>
  );
};

export function SausageNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>A highly varied food, sausage can be meat or vegetable, but is often the ground and encased melange of meat and offal from a number of animals. Most frequently associated with things like bratwurst, bockwurst, linguincia, hot dogs, and chorizo, they are a fantastic centerpiece to a meal or a complement and appetizer. Many cured meats are also members of the sausage family. The hardness and style of preparation can affect which wine matches with the sausage. Try medium bodied reds or sweet and dry whites with most sausages. Harder sausages such as hard salami go well with super dry Chenin Blancs.</p>
  );
};

export function ExoticNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Ever try ostritch? Or alligator? How about guniea pig? Exotic meats are any sort of game or domesticated meat that does not always fall into the traditional palates of most consumers. These meats are often cultural delicacies or unique to their regions. Game and exotic meats often have a heavier or greasier component to them that is lacking from more traditional domesticated meats. Venison, boar, and gamefowl pair well with medium and full bodied red wines. Reptile and exotic bird meats will often pair well with a number of gamuts, but sweeter wines are often preferred by many.</p>
  );
};

export function LightFishNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Light fish (commonly white fish) are a wide variety of fish that tend to be lean, non-fatty, and have a less distinct 'fishy' taste. Tilapia, cod, and halibut are popular options. Most are seafloor or cold water dwellers. White fish pair well with lighter white wines and sparkling wines if the fish is fried. Pinot Grigio, Gamay, Blush Wines, and Moscato are popular options depending on how the fish is prepared.</p>
  );
};


export function DarkFishNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Dark fish are commonly oily and have a distinct fishy flavor. Preparation and type of fish matter heavily for the wine pairing. Like light or white fish, most fish pair well with white wines, but dark, fatty fish like salmon and certain cuts of tuna can pair quite well with medium bodied red wines. Spicier fish dishes go better with sweeter wines, while grilled and prepared/sauced fish dishes are better with lighter and drier white wines.</p>
  );
};

export function ShellfishNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Shrimp, lobster, crab, and shelled molluscs like oysters and scallops pair fantastically with sparkling wines like cava, champagne, and brut or sweet wites like muscatos and sweet riesling. Some preparations also pair well with lighter bodied white wines. As a general rule, avoid oaky or buttery Chardonnays with shellfish! There might be exceptions, but check with a professional sommelier!</p>
  )
}

export function MolluskNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Soft-bodied mollusks like octopi and squid pair well sparkling wines, Sauvignon Blancs, roses, or if grilled, a medium bodied red wine, especially if smoky flavors are introduced.</p>
  )
}

export function DessertNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>You can match any number of desserts with wines. Try ports or grappas. Sweet to augment sweet or dry to complement.</p>
  )
};

export function BreadNote(prop) {
  return (
    <p>Bread is not often served as an entree, but if part of a tasting menu, a few wines, especially rich, flavorful wines like Bordeaux, oaky Chardonnay, and Charbono pair well with almost any bread type.</p>
  )
